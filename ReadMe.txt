To run the project, make sure to have main.cpp, Movie.cpp and Movie.h under the same project. 
Keep the movies.csv file in whatever directory you have set for your IDE for input files. 
You can also generate new movies.csv file by uncommenting some parts of the code, I have left a comment in the code which part to uncomment to achieve this.
All the different attributes of a movie (drama, comedy, action and fiction) have values from 1-3000, 1 meaning the least ammount and 3000 meaning the most amount. 
User can choose to rank each category from 1-4, 1 meaning least emphasis and 4 meaning most emphasis and a suitable movie will be calculated for them.
